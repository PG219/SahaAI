## The Problem

**190 million Indians** are excluded from formal credit — not because they're unreliable, but because they have no credit history. A gig delivery rider who repays ₹500 every week has better financial discipline than many salaried borrowers — but traditional scoring systems give them a zero.

FinAccess AI fixes this by scoring people on their **actual behaviour**: income patterns, repayment consistency, expense ratios — not salary slips. And because 40% of our target users are semi-literate or illiterate, the entire experience is **voice-first**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Chrome** (for voice features)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/finaccess-ai.git
cd finaccess-ai

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in Chrome.

### Using with Real AI (Claude API)

By default the app uses a **keyword-matched mock AI** so it works without any API key. To enable real Claude AI responses:

1. Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Replace the `askAI` function in `App.jsx`:

```js
async function askAI(prompt) {
  setAiLoading(true); setAiResponse(""); voiceEngine.stopSpeaking();
  const res = await fetch("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",           // ← add your key
      "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      max_tokens: 800,
      system: `You are a financial AI advisor for FinAccess...`,
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
    })
  });
  const d = await res.json();
  setAiResponse(d.content?.map(c => c.text || "").join("") || "Unable to respond.");
  setAiLoading(false);
}
```

> ⚠️ Never commit your API key. Use environment variables in production.

## How the Mock AI Works

The built-in mock engine matches keywords from typed or spoken questions and returns personalised responses using the user's **live profile data** (income, expenses, score, risk):

| You ask about | Keywords matched | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Credit score | `credit`, `score`, `improve`, `better` | Score-specific advice with ₹ targets |
| Financial risk | `risk`, `distress`, `danger`, `worried` | Risk % with savings recommendation |
| Loans | `loan`, `which`, `best`, `apply`, `mudra` | SVANidhi / Jan Samarth recommendation |
| Savings | `save`, `budget`, `spend`, `expenses` | Expense ratio breakdown |
| Repayments | `repay`, `missed`, `EMI`, `default` | History-based coaching |
| Technology | `FINN`, `AI`, `model`, `XGBoost` | Plain-language tech explanation |
| Anything else | — | Full profile summary + prompt to ask more |

All responses dynamically use the user's **current slider values**, so moving the income/expense sliders changes the advice.

## Architecture

```
finaccess-ai/
├── src/
│   └── App.jsx              # Single-file React app (all components inline)
├── public/
├── index.html
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### Key components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `useVoiceEngine(lang)` | Custom hook — Web Speech API for STT + TTS, language-aware |
| `VoiceMicButton` | Big accessibility mic button with pulse animation and live transcript |
| `WaveformBars` | Animated equaliser bars for listening/speaking feedback |
| `SpeakButton` | Inline 🔊 button to re-read AI responses |
| `ScoreGauge` | SVG credit score arc with animated needle |
| `SparkLine` | Lightweight SVG sparkline for metric cards |
| `ShapBar` | Horizontal SHAP feature impact bars |
| `AIAdvisorBlock` | Full AI advisor panel (voice + chips + response + TTS) |

### State management

All state is local React (`useState`). The app is fully self-contained — no Redux, no context, no backend required for the demo.

### Voice engine

```
User taps mic
    → SpeechRecognition starts (lang = e.g. hi-IN)
    → interim transcript shown live
    → final transcript → askAI(transcript)
    → mock/real AI returns response
    → SpeechSynthesisUtterance reads it aloud
    → waveform animates during playback
```

---

## Financial Models (Simulated)

### Credit Score Formula (live simulation)
```
score = 750 - (expenseRatio × 200) + (income / 1000 × 2)
clamped to [300, 900]
```

### Risk Percentage
```
riskPct = expenseRatio × 60
```

### FINN Constraints checked in real time
| Rule | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| Expenditure cap | ≤ 90% of income |
| Debt-to-income ratio | ≤ 40% |
| Minimum savings buffer | ≥ 3 months income |
| Repayment floor | ≥ 70% on-time |
| Zero income → zero credit | Hard rule |
| No debt service if income = 0 | Hard rule |

## Fairness & Ethics

FinAccess AI is built with responsible AI principles at its core:

- **No proxy discrimination** — no caste, gender, or address used as credit signals
- **Fairlearn bias audits** — approval rates tracked across gig workers, rural borrowers, SC/ST, women borrowers, youth
- **SHAP explainability** — every score decision is explained in plain language
- **RBI Fair Practices Code** compliant (simulated)
- **DPDP Act 2023** compliant (simulated)
- **Federated learning architecture** — model improves across banks without sharing raw user data
